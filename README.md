Calibration and deembedding for impedance measurments

Three algorithms in Python are used to enable the impedance measurements in wire samples on a vector network analyzer (VNA).
Follow the detailed manual-report saved in the pdf file (Multi-stage calibration for impedance measurements).

You will need the following Python libraries:
  numpy
  matplotlib.pyplot
  math
  scipy
  scipy.interpolate
