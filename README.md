Calibration and deembedding for impedance measurments

A centrepiece of our work is the design of customized printed circuit board cells (see the folder Rogers' PCB cells), optimized to simplify and enhance measurement accuracy. These PCB cells are coupled with a multi-stage calibration process, which ensures that our data is both reliable and adaptable to a range of experimental conditions. This level of precision and flexibility allows for the exploration of surface impedance under external stimuli, such as magnetic field, mechanical stress, or temperature. Our approach not only simplifies the characterization process but also provides a versatile framework for tailoring ferromagnetic microwires to specific applications, from high-performance sensors to innovative metamaterials.

Three algorithms in Python are used to enable the impedance measurements in wire samples on a vector network analyzer (VNA).
